# Enhanced Contact Management SDK v0.3.0

We're excited to announce the release of version 0.3.0 of our ContactsManager SDK, bringing improved security and performance to contact management across platforms.

## What's New

This update delivers an enhanced iOS framework with military-grade security features that keep your users' contact information completely private and secure. The contact information stays with the users only - not even the app developer has access to users' personal contacts, preventing data misuse and spam.

## Why This Matters

In a world where personal data is increasingly vulnerable, our mission is to provide developers with tools that respect user privacy while enabling powerful social features. This update reinforces our commitment to building a platform where contact information is handled with the utmost care, using multi-layer encryption and advanced security protocols.

By implementing our SDK, developers can build social features like activity feeds, follow-unfollow mechanics, and chronological event timelines, all while maintaining full compliance with modern privacy standards.
